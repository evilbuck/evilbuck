ðŸ§  About Me

Iâ€™m a hands-on full-stack engineer with over 20 years of experience building software that solves real-world problems. Iâ€™ve designed commerce platforms, built high-scale analytics pipelines, mentored engineers, and helped ship v2 launches that mattered.

I started in design before UX had a nameâ€”and that mindset still shapes how I build today. I care about clean architecture, thoughtful interfaces, and shipping what matters.

Languages & Frameworks: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript (React, Vue), Node.js
Tools & Infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Docker, CI/CD, DevOps
Current Interests: building small, stable systems; refactoring legacy code; mentoring developers
