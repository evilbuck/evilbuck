About Me

Iâ€™m a hands-on full-stack lead with over 20 years of experience building software that solves real-world problems. Iâ€™ve designed commerce platforms, built high-scale analytics pipelines, mentored engineers, and shipped v2 launches that mattered.

I started in interface design before UX had a name. That mindset still shapes how I build today. I care about clean architecture, thoughtful interfaces, and shipping what matters.

Languages & Frameworks: Ruby, Rails, Python, JavaScript, React, Vue, Node.js, PHP - Too many to list here. I'm a polyglot. Learning or re-learning a language is second nature now.
Tools & Infra: PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, Docker, CI/CD, DevOps
Current Interests: building small, stable systems; refactoring legacy code; mentoring developers, leading teams.
