### Summary

Staff-level Full-Stack Engineer with 20+ years of experience building robust, elegant software products — often solo, often from scratch — across a number of application server platforms, including: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript frameworks, php, and cloud-native platforms.

From crafting a commerce platform at Invative to architecting ML pipelines at BrightBytes, I focus on scalable backend systems, thoughtful UIs, and independent ownership.

Business goals always drive my work — clean code and elegant architecture naturally follow when you're solving the right problems the right way.
